# Bi-disperse-random-packing-algorithm

This algorithm was developed for a Part III project on 'A search for the densest packing of bi-disperse discs in d=2: a numerical investigation' with Professor Raphael Blumenfeld as supervisor. The code was written in Python and can be found in the file titled 'Bi-disperse packing'.
